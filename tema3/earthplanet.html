<p><i>According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence,</i><strong>Earth formed over <mark>4.5 billion years ago</mark></strong></p>
<p><em>Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons on Earth.</em>
<ins>Earth</ins> orbits around the Sun in<sup>365.256 days</sup>, a period known as an Earth sidereal year.
<i>About <strong>71%</strong>of Earth's surface is covered with water, mostly by oceans.</i></p>

<p><em> Over 7.7 billion humans live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and natural resources for their survival.</em>
Humans have developed diverse<q>societies and cultures; politically, the world has around 200 sovereign states.</q>
<p style="background-color:Tomato;">
Earth's atmosphere and oceans were formed by volcanic activity and outgassing.
Water vapor from these sources condensed into the oceans, augmented by water and ice from asteroids, protoplanets, and comets.
