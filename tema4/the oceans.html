<h1><b>World Oceans</b></h1>
<p><em>An ocean is a body of water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. 
On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean.</em></p>
<p>These are, in descending order by area.</p>

<ul> 
  	<li>Pacific</li>
	<li>Atlantin</li>
	<li>Indian</li>
	<li>Southern</li>
	<li>Artic</li>
</ul>
<p><i>The largest ocean on Earth is filled with mysteries, but also subject to great pressures like climate change, plastic pollution, and overfishing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com">The Pacific Ocean is the largest and deepest ocean on Earth.</a></p>
<h1><em>The Pacific Ocean</em></h1>

<p>The second-largest ocean on Earth<span style="border: 1px solid black">the Atlantic</span>drives our weather patterns, including hurricanes, and is home to many species from sea turtles to dolphins.</p>
<div style="background-color:black;color:white;padding:20px;">
<p>It's more than <b>41 million square miles,</b> the second-largest ocean on Earth after the Pacific Ocean.
Scientists and geographers broadly separate the Atlantic in terms of north and south. The North Atlantic and South Atlantic each have distinct ocean currents that influence weather around the world.

<p>The Arctic Ocean may be the world's smallest, but it's becoming a critical region as climate change warms it more quickly than anywhere else on Earth.</p>
<p>The Arctic Ocean is warming faster than anywhere else on Earth and feeling the onslaught of climate change.</p>

<p>The major oceanic divisions – listed below in descending order of area and volume – are defined in part by the continents, various archipelagos, and other criteria</p>

<p>The mid-ocean ridges of the world are connected and form a single global mid-oceanic ridge system that is part of every ocean and the longest mountain range in the world. The continuous mountain range is 65,000 km (40,000 mi) long (several times longer than the Andes, the longest continental mountain range).</p>
