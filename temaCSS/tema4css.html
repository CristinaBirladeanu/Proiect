<p class="normal">Due to its central geographic location in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean, Italy has historically been home to myriad peoples and cultures.</p>
<p class="italic">In addition to the various ancient peoples dispersed throughout what is now modern-day Italy, the most predominant being the Indo-European Italic peoples who gave the peninsula its name, beginning from the classical era, Phoenicians and Carthaginians founded colonies mostly in insular Italy, Greeks established settlements in the so-called Magna Graecia of Southern Italy, while Etruscans and Celts inhabited central and northern Italy respectively.</p>

<p>Don’t touch without permission at the markets</p>
<div>Visiting markets in Italy is something I highly recommend.
Not only can you find the freshest, local produce but you’ll find clothes, cheeses, leather goods, kitchen supplies, and more. But when visiting markets, keep your hands to yourself! Always ask permission to see something and the vendor will wait on you attentively, getting you the correct sizes or selecting your produce for you while wearing plastic gloves. And if you visit a grocery store, you’ll also notice plastic gloves in the produce section.
Be sure to wear them when handling produce.</div>
